# Gmail Email Sender Script

## Overview
This Python script allows you to send an email using Gmail's SMTP server with SSL encryption. It leverages the `smtplib` and `email` libraries to construct and send an email. This script is designed for educational purposes and can be easily adapted for various email sending tasks.

## Features
- Secure email sending using SSL
- Configurable email settings (sender, recipient, subject, content)
- Error handling to catch and display issues during email sending

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Gmail account with 2-Step Verification enabled (recommended)
- App Password generated for your Gmail account (if 2-Step Verification is enabled)
- Allow less secure apps access (if 2-Step Verification is disabled)

## Configuration
1. **Generate App Password**
   - Go to your Google Account settings.
   - Under "Security," enable 2-Step Verification.
   - Generate an App Password and use it in the `sender_password` field.

2. **Update Configuration**
   - Replace `EMAIL_CONFIG['sender_email']` with your Gmail address.
   - Replace `EMAIL_CONFIG['sender_password']` with your App Password (or regular password if 2FA is off).
   - Set `EMAIL_CONFIG['recipient_email']` to the recipient's email address.

3. **Adjust Security Settings**
   - If you don't use 2FA, enable "Less secure app access" in your Google Account settings.

## Running the Script
1. Ensure your Gmail account settings are correctly configured.
2. Install Python 3.x if you haven't already.
3. Save the script to a file, for example, `email_sender.py`.
4. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python email_sender.py
   ```

## Security Notes
- **Never share your password or App Password in public repositories.**
- Consider using environment variables or input prompts for sensitive data like passwords.
- This script is for educational purposes only.

## Troubleshooting
- **"Authentication Failed" Error**: Verify your App Password is correct and 2-Step Verification is enabled.
- **Network Issues**: Ensure your internet connection is stable and SMTP ports (465) are not blocked by firewall/antivirus.
- **Recipient Not Receiving Emails**: Check spam folder and ensure the recipient email is correct.

## Example Output
```
Email sent successfully!
```
